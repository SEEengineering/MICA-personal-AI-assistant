Mica is a project is aimed at identifying an optimal way on building a personal AI virtual assistant using python. The reason is why python is much more beneficial for building an AI is Python is simple to learn and implement. It can also be used for data analysis with their many libraries. A lot of built-in libraries are provided by Python. Many libraries are dedicated to artificial information and machine learning. Some libraries are TensorFlow, a neural networks library with high levels, science studies (for data mining, data analysis and machine learning), pyearn2 (more flexible than science studies), etc. The list continues and does not end. Python has a simple OpenCV implementation. Python's powerful and easy implementation makes it popular to everybody. It is also easier to experiment with new ideas and code prototypes quickly in a language with minimal syntax like Python

## Tech
MICA uses:
- [Python] - a high-level general-purpose programming language that is interpreted!

## Future Work and Recommendation

Although the VPA has over ten often used standard capabilities, more functions that simplify our daily lives and make it more convenient to use might be added.
To make the software more comprehensive and allow users to take advantage of more services, functions such as watching movies, checking stocks, calculating the exchange rate, downloading and uploading files, and installing APPs, among others, might be added.
